# sorter-bot
A simple Minecraft bot designed to organize chests based on item categories, powered by Mineflayer. Commands are only accepted by the given username, everybody else gets ignored. Huge thanks to the creators of [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) for making this possible!

## Commands
I'll revisit this when its ready to use

## Env variables
- TARGET_HOST - Where the bot should connect to. Defaults to localhost.
- TARGET_PORT - The port to use. This one will change a lot.
- BOT_USERNAME - The name the bot will use in-game - Optional
- BOT_PASSWORD - Only applies to legit accounts and online servers, which is strongly discouraged.
- CONTROL_ACCOUNTS - An array of usernames with control permissions.

Aren't sure how to use env varables? [This page](https://codeburst.io/process-env-what-it-is-and-why-when-how-to-use-it-effectively-505d0b2831e7) might help.

## How it works
Same as [Commands](https://github.com/ALU52/sorter-bot#commands)
